<v-click>
```typescript{all|12|2-11|14|all}
update() {
  const availableMoves = [
    "UP",
    "DOWN",
    "LEFT",
    "RIGHT",
    "UP-RIGHT",
    "UP-LEFT",
    "DOWN-RIGHT",
    "DOWN-LEFT",
  ];
  const nextMove = random(availableMoves);

  this.move(nextMove);
}
```

This is called a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk>Random Walk</a>.

<!--- Remember to say Friend has no memory, this is just to illustrate; take note of how much they explored (not very much) --->

# Hello Explorer!

Thanks for taking some time to look through my presentation!

My goal in this talk was to take a different route to showing you about some interesting ideas about random walkers. It's so cool that just a tiny bit of "memory" turns out to make sure a big different in the spaces explored and I wanted to present [Levy flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9vy_flight) in a way that felt relatable (who hasn't lost their phone and searched one area for a while before moving on to another).

I hope that you found this approach **entertaining** and that it sparked something in you. How might you use random walkers? As you look around the world what kind of creatures or systems model a random walk? If you found these ideas interesting you might really enjoy [The Nature Of Code Book](https://natureofcode.com/)

**Super quick about me:** I'm Nicole (hi!). I've spent the last nine years at [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org) working on the practice experience (quizzes, tests, explorable articles!). I was a software generalist there and spent years working on the mobile app, the web frontend, with some work on the backend as well.
