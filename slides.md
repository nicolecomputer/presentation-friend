# A typical day

<v-click>
```typescript{all|12|2-11|14|all}
update() {
  const availableMoves = [
    "UP",
    "DOWN",
    "LEFT",
    "RIGHT",
    "UP-RIGHT",
    "UP-LEFT",
    "DOWN-RIGHT",
    "DOWN-LEFT",
  ];
  const nextMove = random(availableMoves);

  this.move(nextMove);
}
```
</v-click>

<v-click>
This is called a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk>Random Walk</a>.
</v-click>

<!--- Remember to say Friend has no memory, this is just to illustrate; take note of how much they explored (not very much) --->

# A little memory ðŸ¥¦

<v-click>
```typescript{all|1-3|5|8-11|all}
// moves has all available moves
//   without moving Friend off the board
let moves = ["UP", "RIGHT", "UP-RIGHT"]

moves = moves.filter((move) => {
  const proposedLocation = locationToString(
    this.locationOfMove(move));

  return !history
    .map(locationToString)
    .includes(proposedLocation);
});
```
</v-click>

<v-click>
<h3>How to forget</h3>

```typescript
  if (this.memory.length > 2) {
    this.memory = this.memory.slice(1);
  }
```
</v-click>

# LÃ©vy flight

- Another technique friend has recently learned
- Look around but occasionally take a big jump and go explore somewhere else
- Still get stuck

# Friend gets the gummy

- With enough exploring friend does get the gummy
- It makes them very happy

layout: center

# Until next time

Someday you get the gummy, somedays you don't
We leave room for both

Be good to one another
