# LÃ©vy flight

- Another technique friend has recently learned
- Look around but occasionally take a big jump and go explore somewhere else
- Still get stuck

# Friend gets the gummy

- With enough exploring friend does get the gummy
- It makes them very happy

# Until next time

Someday you get the gummy, somedays you don't
We leave room for both

Be good to one another
